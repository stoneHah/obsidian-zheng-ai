Chat SDK is a free, open-source template for building powerful chatbot applications.

The [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) powers [incredible applications](https://sdk.vercel.ai/showcase) across the web, and today we're excited to announce the [Chat SDK](https://chat-sdk.dev/) - the best-in-class, production-ready template for building conversational AI applications like ChatGPT or Claude artifacts.

With the Chat SDK, you get a complete production-ready application built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) App Router with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) at its core, allowing you to use any AI model and provider throughout your application. It leverages the best patterns we've developed and learned from building [v0](https://v0.dev/), and it's always up to date with the latest advancements. Built on strong foundations -- message persistence, authentication, multimodal support, and shareable chats -- the Chat SDK differentiates itself with powerful features like generative UI, customizable artifacts, and in-browser code execution.

With generative UI, you can create dynamic, interactive interfaces that go beyond simple text responses, enabling rich user experiences that adapt to the conversation context.

Custom artifacts allow you to build specialized components tailored to your specific use cases, from document creation to interactive tools that enhance the functionality of your chatbot.

With in-browser code execution, your chatbot can write and run code directly in the browser with WASM and pyodide, without requiring a discrete sandbox setup.
